<h1><b>👋🏽 hi, im bereket━@bereketsemagn</b></h1>

I'm a software developer based in Toronto, ON. I'm passionate about artifical intelligence, open-source, and physics. I enjoy building web applications, websites, applications, apps, and everything in between. My everyday goal is to learn something, that can impact the world, through creativity, curiosity, and technology. I also love to <a href="https://bereketsemagn.tk/blog">write</a>.
