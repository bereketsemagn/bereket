<h1><b>👋🏽 hi, im bereket━@bereketsemagn</b></h1>

I'm a programmer who is passionate about AI, loves to contribute to open-source projects, and enjoys coding in Python, and JavaScript mainly. I enjoy doing both backend and frontend, but I'm not really into mobile development. Besides coding and all that, I love to bike, go on walks, explore, and meet new people! Check out some of my pinned projects and some of my other repositories if you'd like to find out more about my projects, code, and what I love to do!
